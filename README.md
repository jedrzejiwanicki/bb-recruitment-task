### Comments

- There are only few files covered with test, I wanted to focus mainly on the features and the quality of the code, but still prove that I am able to write UTs.
If that's not enough I can deliver some more UTs.
- Extended the JSON file with account details data since I could not figure out where to take this data from
- Frontend code contains logic which alters JSON file directly, this would be unacceptable on production code and
was implemented for simplicity reasons
